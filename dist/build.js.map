class=\"txtbg\">\r\n\t\t\t\t现在很多人购买猫咪，不会去宠物店或者猫舍买猫，很多爱猫者都会去朋友介绍的私人家庭购买，这样不仅是价格实惠，还有一点就是家养的猫咪，可以看到母猫。\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>去私人家庭购买猫咪注意事项</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>现在很多人购买猫咪，不会去宠物店或者猫舍买猫，很多爱猫者都会去朋友介绍的私人家庭购买，这样不仅是价格实惠，还有一点就是家养的猫咪，可以看到母猫。虽然是这样，我们去私人家庭购买猫咪，有些问题还是需要注意的。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>一、去对方家里观察猫咪得生长环境。</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t如果猫咪是被关在笼子里面，而且不常让猫咪们出来透气，那生出来的小猫个性可能会像母猫一样封闭，不太容易亲近人。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>二、观察猫咪的环境卫生还有饮食。</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>他们的猫沙盆干净吗?有没有常常清?他们吃什么牌子的饲料?营养充足吗?</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>三、看他们一共养了多少只猫?是不是很多品种的猫?</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>如果对方养猫超过十几只，而且猫咪各种血统、品种都有，那你可能需要考虑要不要跟他买猫。因为养猫就跟养小孩一样，这位猫主人可能无法好好照顾好每一只小猫，也无法很正确的了解每一只小猫的问题。而且不同品种的猫咪养在一起，会不会生出来的小猫是混种猫呢?</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>四、看小猫的父母以及兄弟姊妹。</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>例如你想要养金吉拉，你就得确认小猫的父母都是金吉拉，也要看看同一胎小猫的兄弟姊妹的样子，是不是都是金吉拉的样子。如果其中有一只不是金吉拉的样子，反而像是波斯猫(详情介绍)或是什么的，心里可能要怀疑一下血统纯不纯了!</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>五、检查小猫的健康状况。</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1.眼睛要清澈有神，不要有眼屎。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.鼻子要微微湿润，不要流鼻涕或是鼻水。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>3.屁屁要干净，不要有拉肚子便便粘到毛上。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>4.皮肤没有霉菌，也没有伤口。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>5.跟他玩耍，牠要愿意亲近人。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>6.最好的方法是约在动物医院请兽医做检查。如果兽医检查出小猫有毛病，原主人有义务负担医药费，或是你可以不要买这只小猫。以上比较适用于私家猫咪的买卖。没有血统证明，但是会比较便宜。</p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script

class=\"txtbg\">\r\n\t\t\t\t实猫咪不仅喜欢呆在主人的床上，电脑、阳台、桌子、冰箱上……都是猫咪喜欢的地方，我们没有办法控制猫咪的自由行动，但是很多主人都想控制猫咪，不让猫咪上主人的床。\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>训练猫不上床的方法</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>其实猫咪不仅喜欢呆在主人的床上，电脑、阳台、桌子、冰箱上……都是猫咪喜欢的地方，我们没有办法控制猫咪的自由行动，但是很多主人都想控制猫咪，不让猫咪上主人的床。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>一、猫咪为什么喜欢主人的床</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t在猫咪看来，最合适睡觉的就是温暖的地方，也许猫咪并没有意识到那是你的床，但是他知道那里是最暖的，并且有熟悉的主人的味道，如果主人不训练猫咪，猫咪会每天呆在主人的床上睡觉。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>二、要为猫咪准备舒服的床</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>要让猫咪不再跳上主人的床，主人就应该为猫咪准备一个温暖舒适的猫窝，猫咪能在自己的窝内舒舒服服的休息，也会减少它跳上主人床的欲望。冬天猫咪喜欢温暖不愿意回到自己的窝，可以在窝里放一个暖水袋，让猫咪舒舒服服温暖过冬。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>三、当猫咪跳上床的时候要呵斥</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>当猫咪跳上床的时候，主人应该适当地呵斥猫咪，要让给猫咪知道，跳上床的行为是错误的。或者拍打猫咪的臀部，将其赶下床。反复多次之后，猫咪就不会在跳上床了。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>四、一些常规方法。</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>网络上对于训练猫咪的方法还是很多的，比如放柚子皮，但是并不是所有的猫都讨厌这个味道，所以成功率很低;还有一些主人直接会打猫，当然只是轻轻的拍打，其实这无疑是最好用的方法，同时主人表现出很生气的样子，猫咪对情绪的理解能力很强，慢慢就会知道这样做不对了;还有很多人建议使用水枪，这是小编不建议的方法，因为水会弄湿家里和猫，影响健康，而且这对猫来说，也是很暴力的方式。</p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script

class=\"txtbg\">\r\n\t\t\t\t狗狗使用马桶排便大家应该并不稀奇，不仅减少了主人很多的麻烦，更能保持家中的卫生，其实只要好好训练猫咪，猫咪的表现并不会比狗狗差，猫咪天生爱干净，所以只要用对方法，训练猫咪上马桶排队并不是什么难事。\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>如何训练猫上马桶排便</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>狗狗使用马桶排便大家应该并不稀奇，不仅减少了主人很多的麻烦，更能保持家中的卫生，其实只要好好训练猫咪，猫咪的表现并不会比狗狗差，猫咪天生爱干净，所以只要用对方法，训练猫咪上马桶排队并不是什么难事。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>一、对猫咪的要求：</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t1.大于六个月，已经会用猫砂盆，养在家里 (我想偶而外出可以，但不能经常外出)。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t2. 如果只有一只猫咪可能好训练一些。多过一只的，最好是把重点放在领头的猫咪身上，希望其它猫咪向它学习。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t3.最好是定时喂食，每天两顿，早晚各一次。(这是因为很多猫咪在吃完东西后会想去上厕所，所以让你比较容易记录哪只上了厕所，NN还是BB, 并可以及时清理。六个月大的猫咪，如果胃口好，身体健康，每天两次喂食还可以防止猫咪体重超重。如果你不愿意把食盆收起来的话，每天就定时加两次食，每次基本上是猫咪的定量，不要太多，一直散放在那里)。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>二、训练猫咪上马桶排便步骤</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1.训练的第一个步骤是把猫砂盆挪到马桶的一侧去。别忘了告诉它猫砂盆搬到哪儿去了。稍待。接下来在猫砂盆下面垫些东西(如一捆旧报纸、一本厚厚的电话号码簿、一个硬纸箱子等)，把猫砂盆垫高三厘米左右。最好不要用杂志，因为杂志的纸质比较滑，会导致猫砂盆放置不稳，猫猫方便的时候会有不安全感。如果需要，你可以用胶带把猫砂盆和下面的垫高物品固定在一起。稍待。再找一个箱子或电话号码簿，把猫砂盆再垫高一点。稍待。持续这个步骤，直到猫砂盆的底部与马桶的顶部持平为止。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t2.在以下的说明里，使用了“稍待”这个词，意思是在接下来的一天或一个星期里不要做任何的改变，时间的长短取决于你的猫适应性怎样。我们这个训练课的主角“米莎”适应性比较强，用了两个星期就完成了全部的训练，这个时间可比那些书里教的方法所估计的要快得多。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t3.你要记住的最重要的事情就是：马桶盖要总是开着的，马桶圈要放下来。在马桶盖的背后贴个字条提醒自己和家人、以及可能使用厕所的来访者(自从米莎学会了用马桶之后，如果哪个来访者把马桶盖给盖上了，米莎就会找我来把它打开;但是你可不能指望所有的猫都有这个意识。此外，米莎用马桶已经有六年了，如果情况一下子发生改变，它马上就会到浴缸里方便)。如果你有上完厕所就关门的习惯，恐怕也要改一改了。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t4.在这个步骤开始的时候，猫猫需要“迈”进猫砂盆里，稍后就得用跳的了，直到某一天它可能会第一次跳到马桶座上，然后从马桶座迈进猫砂盆。在整个训练过程中，你要一直注意让马桶盖开着，马桶圈要放下来，你的猫也完全习惯在开着的马桶上走来走去。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t5.把马桶圈抬起，量一下马桶座的内径和外径。买一个直径与马桶相仿的金属盆。不要用塑料盆，因为塑料盆质地较软，不能承受猫的体重，有可能会变形并翻倒，把猫砂撒得到处都是，更会把猫吓着。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t6.接下来的步骤就是把猫砂盆放到开着盖的马桶上。如果你的猫不太适应，你可能就需要把这个步骤一分为二：先把猫砂盆的一半架在马桶上，过一段时间再把整个猫砂盆都放到马桶上。把原来垫在猫砂盆下面的东西(报纸、电话号码簿等)全部挪走。稍待。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t7.接下来就到了最酷的部分啦。把猫砂盆拿走(哈哈!)，把金属盆架到马桶上。在盆里放上六厘米厚的猫砂。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t8.自然，在这个时候人要用马桶的时候都会先把金属盆拿开，方便之后再把金属盆放回原处。在接下来的一到两周时间里，你可能会感觉非常麻烦，但是只要想想从此之后你可以省一笔买猫砂的钱，也不用再给猫清理猫砂盆，这样做还是值得的!\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t9.注意观察你的猫，看它在使用金属盆的时候是把几只脚放在马桶上的;放在马桶圈上的脚越多，你就越走运，你的工作也会进行得越顺利，因为接下来你就要教它正确的“蹲坑”姿势了。在它方便的时候，教给它应该如何把脚放好，也就是说要把它的脚从盆里拿出来并放在马桶圈上(前脚在马桶圈中间的位置，后脚在后面)。如果它一开始就把三只脚放在盆里，或者——天哪，四只脚都在盆里，就先把两只前脚放在马桶圈上。每次它自己把两只前脚放在马桶圈上的时候都要表扬它一番。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>三、猫咪憋着不用厕所，怎么办?</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t1.很多猫咪在开始训练之后，不象使用猫砂盆一样频繁地去上厕所。不过，至少应该每天大便一次，小便一到两次(最好是两次，不过有些猫咪喝水少，一次也不算憋得很严重)。小便猫咪往往不会一直憋着，而且也不太反感用马桶，大便如果憋了一天，第二天要想办法让他上厕所。可以使用的办法：\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t2.在吃完食后，把他关进厕所，看他会不会大便，关大概30分钟，大便后就放出来。如果关了30分钟，还不上厕所，就放出来。很多猫咪被关之后就上厕所了，可能是跟猫砂盆在一个房间，他总被提醒，有心理作用。有些猫咪会渐渐知道，如果不上厕所，就会被关;如果上了，就被解放，所以一旦被关，就主动去上厕所了。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t3.如果关了之后还是不肯上，你可以喂他吃他爱吃的猫罐头(或其它有水分，且他爱吃的食物)，吃完之后过15分钟再关起来。看他上不上厕所。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t4.如果还是不肯上，你需要喂他点毛球膏。毛球膏有软化大便的作用，有点象轻微的泻药。往往吃点毛球膏，就能够让猫咪最终憋不住去上厕所了。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t5.同样，憋尿的话，就多鼓励他喝水，或吃含很多水份的食物，他自然就憋不住去上厕所了。如果出现憋尿和大便的现象，说明你的进度太快，要停下来，给猫咪时间去适应。一般不要连续每天都扩大孔，除非你的猫咪根本不在意，若无其事地去上厕所，不在马桶前盘旋并哀怨地叫着。花花就是这样，我从没听她抱怨过一声，而且每天要NN好几次，BB也每天都有。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t6.另外请记得，孔扩大后，猫咪的不适应往往不是在当天出现，很多猫咪的反应是滞后的，大概要滞后3-4天，所以为了保险起见，扩孔的间隔最好在4天以上。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t训练猫咪在马桶上排便可以减少猫咪吸食猫砂的粉尘，保证猫咪的基本健康，何乐而不为呢?在训练的过程中，主人只要有耐心，用正确的方法，相信猫咪很多就会学会用马桶排便了。\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script

月饼、桃酥、麻花、香蕉、肉包、包包、肉肉、丸子、肉丸、咖啡、摩卡、奶糖、糖糖、巧克力等。给猫咪起名字</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2、如果这个主人有很多崇拜的偶像，也完全可以用偶像的名字来给猫咪命名： 贝克汉姆(简称小贝)、乔丹(简称丹丹)、姚明(简称小明)、张三丰(小名：三儿)、奥巴马等，你甚至还可以用动漫作品中的虚拟偶像的名字为自己的猫咪命名，比如：路飞、乔巴、奈美、起司(动画《甜甜起司猫的主角》)、mike(动画《乖猫mike》的主角)等等，都是些很可爱的猫咪名字。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>四、根据猫咪的花色来取名</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>三花：拉面、花花、晓堇、笑笑、橘子</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>全白：小白、大白、雪糕、雪妮、雪铃、棉花、小云、白雪、小新、小不点、奶糖\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>黄色狸花：金环、奶酪、如意、布丁、蛋蛋</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>黑白：奶牛、玉珠、乌云、墨墨、黑珍珠、小墨、点点</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>黑色狸花：虎子、豹子、木耳、花花</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>全黑：小墨、夜一、小黑、嘿嘿、嘿姆</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>黄白：橙子、桔子、阳阳、小菊、黄黄、大黄、阿黄、金子、金豆</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>五、用自己喜欢的品牌给猫咪起名字</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>比如：Honda、Mini或是cooper，法拉力等等，这种作法还是挺有个性的，只是可惜的是，几乎所有大家心怡的品牌都是洋货，似乎没有人给猫咪起名叫“联想”或是“爱国者”。</p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script

猫用指甲刀。</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>它们设计成从适当的角度剪掉爱猫的指甲而不会有指甲劈裂或碎裂的危险。这些指甲刀设计得像剪刀或环状铡刀。最好的指甲刀有非常锋利的刀刃和舒适的手柄。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>三、具体步骤</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>握住爪子，手指轻轻的压住它并用拇指将指甲从它的爪子中按出来。用你的另一只手去修剪指甲。不要忘记剪 “ 拇指 ” ，在前腿的内侧。只要剪尖端的指甲，一般是白色的，避免剪到粉红色的活肉，否则会流血。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>四、让猫咪对剪指甲有好感</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<p>剪指甲做的要快，如果你的猫已经开始烦躁就放它走即使只剪了一只或两只爪子。你可以以后再继续。要陪它玩耍或给予零食作为奖励它，这样它就会对剪指甲产生好的联想。修剪方法和工具都正确，猫咪还会不配合你的修剪吗?</p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script
